# Instacram
## COMP2041 - 2018, Instagram copy

A single page application that mimics [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com) implemented with HTML, CSS and vanilla javascript. I implemented all the basic functionality such as registration, making a post, following people, editing a post, liking posts, comment on posts, live updates of the feed, etc.

I also implemented more complex functionality such a [push notifications](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Push_API), infinite scroll and offline use through caching. Here are a few screenshots.

I styled the webapp with [Bulma](https://bulma.io/)
