# Policy Pilot
# React Native App, January 2018

PolicyPilot is a simple, colourful app that highlights good, neutral and bad points in the terms and conditions of over 60 web services. PolicyPilot provides relevant links to the terms and conditions of some of these web services. PolicyPilot also has the option to submit an issue for the terms and conditions of a web service, which once after undergoing a successful review will then be added to the data shown in PolicyPilot. PolicyPilot aims to convey the 'fine print' in a digestible, user-friendly manner, as we want legal information to be accessible to all.
