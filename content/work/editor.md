# Editor
## Grammar Parser and Syntax Highlighter

Custom language grammar tokenizer and theming/syntax highlighter with integrated editor written in Swift, designed for use in both macOS and iOS.

Based on the [Textmate Grammar language](https://macromates.com/manual/en/language_grammars) and [vscode's implementation](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-textmate). Contains a subset of the textmate grammar features with it's own extensions.

Allows applying all NSAttributedString attributes as well as custom Editor attributes such as actions, rounded background colors and hiding characters (useful for hiding markdown syntax)!

Add Editor to your application with the Swift Package Manager to easily create an editor with non-trivial features.
